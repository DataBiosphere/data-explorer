Real data is indexed with one of the indexers in
https://github.com/DataBiosphere/data-explorer-indexers

This script loads [test data](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv)
into Elasticsearch, so one can quickly try out Data Explorer.

TODO(melissachang): Use a more interesting and realistic test dataset.

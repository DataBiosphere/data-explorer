The [teaching dataset](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/teaching/) for the Framingham Heart Study.

Please note the disclaimer from that site: Users are cautioned that teaching datasets are completely unsuitable for publication purposes since specific statistical measures were used to create anonymous versions.

As with the 1000_genomes dataset, this repo reads the index from a JSON file for convenience. Use `dump_index.py` to update the JSON file.

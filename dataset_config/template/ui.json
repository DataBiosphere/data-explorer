// search_placeholder_text:
//   Optional. What to show in the search box by default. Adjust the terms for
//   your dataset. For example, "exome" is good for 1000 Genomes because there
//   are a bunch of exome-related facets that don't automatically appear (ie
//   they aren't in this file).
// facets:
//   Facets to be shown in the UI. Facets will appear in the order they are
//   listed here. ui_facet_description is optional.
// enable_search:
//   Search is opt-in while it's under development. After this
//   feature is done, this flag will be removed and the feature will be enabled
//   for all Data Explorers.

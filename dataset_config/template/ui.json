// search_placeholder_text:
//   What to show in the search box by default. Adjust the terms for your
//   dataset. For example, "exome" is good for 1000 Genomes because there are a
//   bunch of exome-related facets that don't automatically appear (ie they
//   aren't in this file).
// facets:
//   Facets to be shown in the UI. Facets will appear in the order they are
//   listed here. ui_facet_description is optional.

## Generating `requirements.txt`

`requirements.txt` is autogenerated from `requirements-to-freeze.txt`. The
latter lists only direct dependencies. To regenerate run:

```
virtualenv /tmp/data-explorer-api
source /tmp/data-explorer-api/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-to-freeze.txt
pip freeze | sort -f > requirements.txt
deactivate
```
